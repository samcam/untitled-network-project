Untitled - Creating the future of connection billing & management.

We're a little non-profit building open-source software for connection makers.

Untitled was founded in 2022 to create a new platform focused solely on smart ISP / Hotspot billing & management.

Our mission is to create the best open-source tools for internet providers, small or big across the world. We're building a sustainable business around a free core application, funded by a premium platform as a service to run it on.

Behind the scenes, we're just a small group of weird, fun-loving humans who enjoy experimenting with new technology. We believe in creating as much freedom in the world as possible, and everything we do is based on that core principle.

Untitled is being set up as a non-profit foundation so that it would always be true to its users, rather than shareholders or investors. Our legal constitution ensures that the company can never be bought or sold, and one hundred percent of our revenue is reinvested into the product and the community.

We call this Sustainable Open Source.

The more people who use Untitled, the more customers we have, the more revenue we receive, the more great people we can hire to work for the foundation, the better the software gets, the more people use Untitled and so on. It's a virtuous cycle which means that we can keep creating open, adaptable software with a vibrant future, forever.
